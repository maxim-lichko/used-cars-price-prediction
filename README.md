# used-cars-price-prediction

### Project Overview
This project aims to predict the selling price of used vehicles using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The project helps insurance companies set optimal prices based on various features such as mileage, brand, fuel type, and more.

### Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Vehicle Sales Data
Records: ~558,837 rows
Features: 15 input variables (e.g., brand, mileage, transmission) + 1 target (selling price)
Problem Statement: The goal is to build a regression model to predict the price of a used car.

### Methodology
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, standardizing formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding feature distribution and correlation.
Feature Engineering: Encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.
Modeling: Various machine learning models including:
* Lasso and Ridge Regression
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Random Forest Regressor
