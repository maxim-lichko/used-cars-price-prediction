# used-cars-price-prediction

### Project Overview
This project aims to predict the selling price of used vehicles using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The project helps insurance companies set optimal prices based on various features such as mileage, brand, fuel type, and more.

### Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Vehicle Sales Data<br>
Records: ~558,837 rows<br>
Features: 15 input variables (e.g., brand, mileage, transmission) + 1 target (selling price)<br>
Problem Statement: The goal is to build a regression model to predict the price of a used car.

### Methodology
1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, standardizing formats.<br>
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding feature distribution and correlation.<br>
3. Feature Engineering: Encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.<br>
4. Modeling: Various machine learning models including:<br>
  * Lasso and Ridge Regression
  * Decision Tree Regressor
  * Random Forest Regressor
